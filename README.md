# Project Proposal

## Project title

Online Discussion and Sharing Platform - Thoughts

## What and why?

The software system that we are going to build is an online discussion and sharing platform where users are able to share their opinions, post or answer questions, and chat with others from a variety of channels designated for different topics. We believe this system is important because nowadays with so much information floating around on the Internet, it is quite difficult for people to find all the information they need in one place. Therefore, by creating this online discussion and idea-sharing platform, we offer a safe and friendly environment that encourages people to share their opinions and seek help or answer to all kinds of topics-related questions or concerns.


## For whom?

Since people can ask, share, and chat about whatever topics that they are interested in, this software is essentially open to anyone who is willing to create a positive impact on the Internet. For example, under the “technical interview” channel, people who have no prior coding interview experience can ask about preparation suggestion, while other experienced individuals can respond to all kinds of questions or share their personal experience related to technical interview.

## How?

* as a non registered user, I can register a new account on the site
* as a non registered user, I can search (channel names, subjects, etc.) and browse through different channels and see what others are discussing, but I'm not allowed to chat, post or answer questions, and share opinions unless I become a registered user
* as a registered user, I can search (channel names, subjects, etc.) and browse through different channels, while able to chat, post or answer questions, and share personal opinions with others
* as an admin, I can login to the admin panel and monitor all activities going on within each channel
* as an admin, I can make changes to inappropriate information that the system detects(profanity, sensitive information, etc.)


## Scope

This proposal is appropriate for a group of 4-6 programmers to undertake in one semester as there are a number of features we need to implement and take care of:
* Front end set up (user login, admin login, user register, admin panel, tons of channels)
* Plenty of background requests to handle (user & admin authentication & verification, user & admin features, database management, etc.)
